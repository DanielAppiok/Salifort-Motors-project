# Predicting Salifort Motors HR Churn.

**Overview :**
The goal of this project was to create a logistic regression and tree-based models to predict employee churn. This project utilized data obtained from the organization HR. The logistic regression model achieved precision of 80%, recall of 83%, f1-score of 80% (all weighted averages), and accuracy of 83%, on the test set. After conducting feature engineering, the decision tree model achieved AUC of 93.8%, precision of 87.0%, recall of 90.4%, f1-score of 88.7%, and accuracy of 96.2%, on the test set. The random forest modestly outperformed the decision tree model.


**Modeling and Evaluation :**
Logistic regression and tree-based models(Decision tree and Random forest) were used in this project. The logistic regression model achieved precision of 80%, recall of 83%, f1-score of 80% (all weighted averages). The decision tree model achieved AUC of 93.8%, precision of 87.0%, recall of 90.4%, f1-score of 88.7%, and accuracy of 96.2%, on the test set.


**Conclusion :**
The models and the feature importances extracted from the models confirm that employees at the company are overworked. Salifort Motors should hold company-wide and within-team discussions to understand and address the company work culture, across the board and in specific contexts.
